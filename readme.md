# Shortener URL

**Objective:** To create a URL Shortener website.

**Details:**

- This test asks you to create a web application (backend + frontend) allowing to generate a shortened URL of a given URL via a web page.
- This shortened URL will allow the client having this link, to be automatically redirected to the original URL.
- You can be greatly inspired by the functioning of equivalent sites such as [bit.ly](http://bit.ly/) to perform this test.
- An administration interface allowing to see the already reduced URLs and to delete them would be a plus, but it is not mandatory

The goal is simply to see how you would approach a technical problem, so you don't have too many constraints for the realization of this test.

However, we want most of the code to be written in Python, but you are free to use any frameworks and libraries you like.

On the front end, you are free to use whatever you want, even if for this exercise, we will prefer a functional website rather than an aesthetic one.

You will have to make this test in a public Git repository (GitHub or GitLab will be enough)
